Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

- create branch on local machine

- make modifications

- run tests and documentation
  in docs/
  make clean
  make doctest
  make html

- If the test changes the images or that new test data is required
  the a new test dataset will have to be published in a new version of the repository on zenodo
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3635906    
  At the moment, only me (dominik) can do that 

  Update to download_test_data.sh will be necessary

- adjust version number in VERSION

- describe changes in CHANGELOG

- commit everything, push branch to github, open merge/pull request

- check that documentation builds on RTD
  In admin settings, change default to latest and select new branch
  "latest" will be built from that branch
  check if docs renders well

- make bundle by running:
    - You probably want to cleanup
    python setup.py clean --all
    rm -rf dist
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

- upload to TEST pypi
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

- upload to official pypi repo
twine upload dist/*

- when all the above worked, 
  add version tag and push to github
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m 'version 2.0.0 with CamelCase removed'
   git push github --tags
  "stable" will be build on RTD


For CONDA package

- go in conda_build directory 
        Command for adding conda build tools
        conda install anaconda-client conda-build
  run
conda skeleton pypi domutils
conda build domutils
    this will automatically upload to anaconda.org

        - Can test local build with:
        conda install -c file:///home/ords/mrd/rpndat/dja001/python_miniconda3/envs/test1/conda-bld/ domutils
        
        - test the conda package in a frest conda environment with:
        conda install -c dja001 domutils
