to avoid noisy outputs you may want to change silent_import in the pysteps config file

Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

- create branch on local machine

- make modifications

- if test_data is not in the root directory, get it with 
  ./scripts/download_test_data.sh

   On the science network, can link to dataset with:
   /home/dja001/shared_stuff/files/test_data_for_domutils_on_zenodo/v?.?.?

- run unit tests
  pytest -xvs

    This should find and run ~150 tests

- run doctests and make documentation
  cd docs/
  make clean
  make doctest
  make html

Before publication of a new version, run tests against multipls python+matplotlib+cartopy combinations
- scripts/run_tox_tests.sh


- If the test makes a figure or that new test data is required
  the a new test dataset will have to be published in a new version of the repository on zenodo
  At the moment, only me (dominik) can do that. Contact me and I will do it for you. 

  Instructions for updating the zenodo archive:

     - Make sure that you start with the current version of test_data on zenodo
       cd /root/of/domutils/package/
       ./scripts/download_test_data.sh

     - run the tests, generated figures will be compared with reference figures in test_data

     - if needed, update the reference figures after making sure that the result is correct

     When you are happy with the changes, you have to update the Zenodo repository

     - Go in the directory containing test datasets:
       cd /home/dja001/shared_stuff/files/test_data_for_domutils_on_zenodo/

     - Copy the modified test_data directory into its own versionned directory
       cp -r  ~/python/packages/domutils_package/test_data v1.0.10

     - List differences with previous version and build .tgz for archive
      cd v1.0.9 (most recent version)
      chmod 755 prepare_tgz_for_zenodo.sh
                                  name of previous version
      ./prepare_tgz_for_zenodo.sh v1.0.8 

     - Login on zenodo with @gmail.com account
       - go on domutils repo, click update
       - delete files that are modified
       - upload new and modified files
         - don't forget to add new files and .tgz if needed
       - change publication date
       - change version
       - publish

     - get record number by clicking on new version
       eg  5497958

     - adjust version and record number in scripts/download_test_data.sh


  If the zenodo archive was changed, it must be tested
  rm -rf test_data test_results
  Updating the dataset version and file list will be necessary
  ./scripts/download_test_data.sh

  Run the tests with the new test_data directory if it got changed

- adjust version number in VERSION

- describe changes in CHANGELOG

- make bundle by running:

    -  cleanup
    rm -rf dist

    - build
    python -m build

    - upload to official pypi repo (pypi API is specified in ~/.pypirc)
    twine upload dist/*
    
- commit everything, push branch to github, open merge/pull request

- check that documentation builds on RTD, by loggin in and verifying status

- when all the above worked, 
  add version tag and push to github
   git checkout master
   git pull github master
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m 'version 2.0.0 with CamelCase removed'
   git push github --tags
  "stable" will be build on RTD





        
- test the conda package in a fresh conda environment with:
conda install -c dja001 domutils

- upgrade domutils in an existing environment with:
conda upgrade -c dja001 domutils
